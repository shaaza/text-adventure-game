## Introduction
The text adventure game from "Land of Lisp" by Conrad Barski, with a few personal modifications over time. To see the how the game is different from the one in the book, please read the Modifications section.

### How to Run the Game
1. If you haven't already, install CLISP.
2. From your command-line interface (Terminal for Mac OSX), run 'clisp the-wizard-game.lsp'


## Modifications
Many modifications were made based on my learning and changing preferences over time. Three definite sources that primarily influenced these changes were: 
* The Systematic Program Design (MOOC on edX) by Prof. Gregor Kiczales at UBC
* The Introduction to Game Design (MOOC on edX) by Prof. Philip Tan and Prof. Sarah Verilli at MIT
* Structure and Interpration of Computer Programs (book) by Gerald Sussman and Hal Abelson
