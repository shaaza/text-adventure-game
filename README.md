# Modifications
Many modifications were made based on my learning over time. Two definite sources that primarily influenced these changes were: 
* The Systematic Program Design (MOOC on edX) by Prof. Gregor Kiczales at UBC
* The Introduction to Game Design (MOOC on edX) by Prof. Philip Tan and Prof. Sarah Verilli at MIT
* Structure and Interpration of Computer Programs (book) by Gerald Sussman and Hal Abelson
